# Valuable Map Features List

Values can be added together for an extremely rough estimate of how valueable something is on the map.
For instance, a city (+) that's chained (+) in a constested area (+) is likely more valuable than an Isolated City (+) that requires a transport to access (-).

| --- | --- |
| X | Game warping. Do not add to maps in most circumstances.
| ++++ | Absurdly Valuable (Properties with this rating before modifiers should not be put in heavily contested areas under most circumstances. Possible instant win situations)
| ++ | Very Valuable |
| + | Valuable |
| 0 | Negligable Value |
| - | Negative Value |
