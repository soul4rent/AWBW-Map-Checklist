Map Features that Help Prevent Stalling:

| Feature Name | Feature Description |
| --- | --- |
| Diagonal fronts | When fronts are wider, it means that players have more angles to attack into. Since most units can be wall broken in 2 hits, it makes it a lot harder to wall |
| Wider fronts | When fronts are wider, it gives opportunity for players to go around any attempts at walling and stalling off, and gives players more choices. More choices usually means more gameplay, which leads to less stalling. As a rule of thumb, fronts that are at least 1 tank turn wide tends to help prevent stalling.|
| Reasonable access to front shifting | Attacking into a stall is miserable. How do you avoid this? Move your army and attack into a place that isn't stalling! |
| Strategically placed defensive terrain | Make sure full vehicle movements can't sit and "park" on extremely high defensive terrain like cities and silos near fronts, or put extremely defensive terrain on pivots. In general, defending is better than attacking, so if players can just "full move and park", they WILL just "full move and park". |
