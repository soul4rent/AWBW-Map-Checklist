Map Features that Help Prevent Stalling:

| Feature Name | Feature Description |
| --- | --- |
| Diagonal fronts | When fronts are wider, it means that players have more angles to attack into. Since most units can be wall broken in 2 hits, it makes it a lot harder to wall |
| Wider fronts | When fronts are wider, it gives opportunity for players to go around any attempts at walling and stalling off, and gives players more choices. More choices usually means more gameplay, which leads to less stalling. As a rule of thumb, fronts that are at least 1 tank turn wide tends to help prevent stalling. **Note: Larger maps might need wider fronts to prevent stalling.**|
| Reasonable access to front shifting | Attacking into a stall is miserable. How do you avoid this? Move your army and attack into a place that isn't stalling! |
| Strategically placed defensive terrain | Make sure full vehicle movements can't sit and "park" on extremely high defensive terrain like cities and silos near fronts, or put extremely defensive terrain on pivots. In general, walling off is easier than attacking, so if players can just "full move and park", they WILL just "full move and park". |
| Less bases and airports | In order for a map to stall, it usually needs a lot of units on the map, such as a lot of infantry getting in the way. If your map is limited to 2-3 bases and 1-2 airports, it will be harder to create enough units to wall off areas. **Note: Base Light maps are less likely to stall.**|
| Less turns until aggressive action | How do you prevent people from building up a large number of units? Kill them off! More early aggressive action means more killed units! More killed units means less unit count! |
