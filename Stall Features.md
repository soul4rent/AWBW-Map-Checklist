**Map Features that Help Prevent Stalling:**

| Feature Name | Feature Description |
| --- | --- |
| Diagonal Fronts | When fronts are wider, it means that players have more angles to attack into. Since most units can be wall broken in 2 hits, it makes it a lot harder to wall |
| Wider Fronts | When fronts are wider, it gives opportunity for players to go around any attempts at walling and stalling off, and gives players more choices. More choices usually means more gameplay, which leads to less stalling. As a rule of thumb, fronts that are at least 1 tank turn wide tend to help prevent stalling. **Note: Larger maps might need wider fronts or more fronts to prevent stalling.**|
| Lots of Fronts | If there's lots of places to fight, and a single front gets walled off, you can just go to another one! |
| Reasonable Access to Front Shifting | Attacking into a stall is miserable. How do you avoid this? Move your army and attack into a place that isn't stalling! |
| Strategically placed Defensive Terrain | Make sure full vehicle movements can't sit and "park" on extremely high defensive terrain like cities and silos near fronts, or put extremely defensive terrain on pivots. In general, walling off is easier than attacking, so if players can just "full move and park", they WILL just "full move and park". However, you can place defensive terrain next to cities in a place that's slightly easier for one player to reach than the other in order to encourage that city to be attacked into.|
| Less Bases and Airports | In order for a map to stall, it usually needs a lot of units on the map, such as a lot of infantry getting in the way. If your map is limited to 2-3 bases and 1-2 airports, it will be harder to create enough units to wall off areas. **Note: Base Light maps are less likely to stall, but are more "punishing" to play since unit count matters more.**|
| Less Turns Until Initial Aggressive Action | How do you prevent people from building up a large number of units? Kill them off! More early aggressive action means more killed units! More killed units means less unit count! |
| Asymmetrical or Dynamic Base/Airport Placement | Dynamic "Mixed Base" layouts tend not to stall, and asymmetrical non-mixed base layouts with more bases/airports on one side of the map tend not to stall. People attack when they have an advantage. |
| Important Properties and Areas to Fight Over | Making some very important properties like com towers contested, or having very early contested properties means that players are less likely to wall and more likely to fight. After all, if they wall up, their opponent gets the important property instead of them! |

**Map Features that Promote Stalling:**

| Feature Name | Feature Description |
| --- | --- |
| Flat fronts | Walling with units is easier when you can't attack them twice. If a front is flat, try and make sure it's wide enough to attack around to try and get an advantage! |
| Narrow Fronts and Chokes | Chokes tend to stall VERY hard, and are very easy to wall off. If you have very narrow fronts, they tend to stall. A lot. |
| Very Few Fronts to Fight On | If there's not a lot of places to fight, there's more opportunities for players to wall off all of those fronts. |
| No Front Shifting | No front shifting means if a front becomes stally, there's very little way for it to become unstally. |
| Poorly Placed Defensive Terrain | Defensive terrain is valuable to players, and they will park on it if it's available. Make sure defensive terrain isn't placed on very important pivots, and Full Move tank turns can't park EXACTLY on important defensive terrain like cities and silos. |
| More Bases and Airports | Most maps are 2-3 bases and 1-2 airports for a reason. Lots of units means lots of potential for stalling! |
| More Turns Until Initial Aggressive Action | Most experienced mappers recommend maps have aggressive action before turn 10, with most maps having less than 4 tank turns until playsers start fighting eachother. More time to build up means more units, and more units means more potential to stall |
| Symmetrical Base/Airport Layout | Ask a Map Committee member about Vulcan :^). If players can't attack into an advantage, they likely won't attack. Not attacking causes unit buildup, and unit buildup causes stalling. |
| Very few contested properties and areas | Why attack when you can capture everything important, sit back, and relax until you gain an overwhelming advantage? |
