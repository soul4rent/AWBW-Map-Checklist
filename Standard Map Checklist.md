# AWBW-Map-Checklist

If a map meets all checklist items under the C rank checklist, a map can usually be safely marked a minimum of C rank.

If most of the checklist items under the B rank checklist are marked, the map will likely be marked "New".

For A ranks and above, ranking maps is extremely difficult due to the complexity of competative play.

Exceptions apply to many of the list items.

## Standard C Rank Map Checklist
- Are FTA counters implemented properly?
  - Does one exist?
  - Is it proper for the number of bases, map type, etc.
- Is the map mirrored in some form?
- Are there no contested bases?
- Are there no contested airports?
- Are all bases at least 1.5 tank turns away from interaction?
- Are all bases less than 5 tank turns away from interaction?
- Are there no instant win features?
- Are fronts at least several tiles wide?
- Is the map reasonably playble?
  - Is there some sort of interaction or threat before turn 10?
  - Are there no obvious cheese strategies, or strategies that have significant first or second turn advantage?
    - EX: Very easily accessible missile silos
    - EX: HQs that one player can rush before the other can defend
    - EX: A base where saving up enough money to build a piperunner wins the game with no counterplay
    - EX: Bases and Airports that can be locked by Rockets, Artillary, or Missiles without significant effort
    - EX: A bunch of easily accessed predeployed non-transport units
- Are some of the income sources contested?
- Are some of the income sources reasonably safe?
- Is the income to base ratio not absurd? (EX: Income is not 40,000 Income per base)
- Is the number of unique features not absurd? (EX: 50 Com towers)
- Are most cities spaced out more than 1 tile away from eachother?
- Are most areas of the map reasonably used, and the unused areas "blocked off" by terrain? (EX: Sea tiles, mountains, pipes, large amounts of forest, etc)
- Is there a reasonable number of pre-owned properties? (Likely just a few bases and an HQ/Lab)
- Is there some amount of terrain variety? (EX: The map isn't just all plains or all roads)

## Standard B Rank Map Checklist
- Are there reasons to go specific places throughout the map? (Com towers, Airports, Contested Income Sources, Larger income sources, Lab Units)
    - If a player wins a single area, is the game still reasonably winnable in some fashion? (EX: No "Win mid, win game")
- Are there several interesting decisions when moving throughout the map?
- Can players front switch to some degree?
- Do fronts (in general) have non-stally features such as:
  - Defensive terrain that encourages aggression (Make sure full tank turns can't sit on important cities!)
  - Diagonal fronts
  - X > 2 tile choke points
- Are there fronts that are wide enough (usually one tank turn), or if they aren't, are they at least interesting?
- Is there a reasonable number of unique features?
  - Airports (usually 1-2)
  - Com towers (Usually 1-2 per player)
- Are HQs/Labs positioned in a place where they aren't easily contested, where the optimal strategy is to focus the HQ?
    - Is it possible for a player to push the Lab(s) or HQ(s) when they have a very large advantage to close out the game?
- Are bases responsible for a reasonable number of fronts? (1-3 per base)
- Is the income to base ratio reasonable? (2 Bases: 6k-11k, 3 Bases: 5k - 9k)
- If the map has pipe seams, does breaking them provide a reasonable amount of value (Not too much "instant win")?
- If the map is an island hopping map, are there at features that encourage dynamic play? (some pre-deployed landers so it isn't only infantry and air, larger islands that are multiple tank turns in size from the landing points, etc)
- Is the Map not an absurd size? (EX: 50 x 50, 10 x 10)
- Is the income difference between capture phases for each base not absurd? (EX: strong side bases have 20 cities, weak side base has 5 cities)
- Is the map somewhat readable and not extremely busy?
- Are players not forced to build transports to reasonably access most contested areas of the map?
- Do most of the map features work as intended? (EX: Is it optimal to interact with most of the features of a map instead of ignoring them and rushing HQ)
- Are there cheese strategies that cause massive FTA (EX: Day 3 recon)

## Standard A Rank Map Checklist
Note: This is where map ranking becomes a lot more difficult and subjective to rank. Interesting B rank maps are often picked for tournaments, and if people like them, they are promoted to A rank and vice versa.

- Are there enough non-obvious choices for players to make throughout the map?
- Does the map have a ABBA or BAAB opening order for the optimal vehicle, without specific FTA cheese strats?
    - If the map has a fast airport or battlecopter opening, does it not force FTA by requiring an AA to be built for first vehicle?
- Is defensive terrain placed in locations that make the map more interesting to play?
- Does the map allow multiple expressions of playstyles? (EX: A defensive playstyle vs an "all out attack" playstyle)
- Are there many choices made throughout the map, most of which are non-obvious?
- Is the value of each base players play on roughly equal in value?
- Is there an even (not odd) number of contested properties across all fronts?
- Is there a proper front switching balance between purely open "Deathball" fronts and isolated "Pure damage race" fronts?
