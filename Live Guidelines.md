# Live Tag Guidelines:

## Size: At most 22 tiles wide or tall, size <= 400 tiles heavily preferred.

There are sometimes exceptions for standard and fog, but there is a lot more leeway for high funds. As a rule of thumb, make a smaller maps.
**Make sure your player's bases are at most ~3.5 tank turns away from eachother.**

## If there are pre-deployed transports, don't have too many. They must be simple and obvious in how to use them.

When in doubt, do not include predeployed transports in your map. Blackboats protecting valuable properties, and transports in very small confined locations are sometimes fine.

## Non-sharp capture phases (if someone speeds through obvious decisions, they won't be set back significantly)

A more subjective criteria, but this means "If I am a player and I bumble through obvious decisions during the capture phase, will I be left behind?".

**Examples of capture phase traps that aren't good for the live tag:**
- Income generating properties in between neutral bases: This is fine for slow mode maps, but for fast mode it can sometimes lead to an early aggressive tank at extremely high levels. Makes the capture phase a lot more complicated.
- Making areas of the map a lot less valuable than others: In general, all contested areas of the map should attempt to be somewhat similar in value. If you don't know how to make areas of a map more or less valuable, you can reference the valuable map features guide.
- Capture phases where you are expected to build transports (potentially fine in fog): Fine on some maps, but in general adding a forced expected transport build can add a ton of complexity and required prior map knowledge.

## At most ~20k income (Standard and Fog)

There are very very few exceptions to this guideline.

## At least 6k starting income (High funds)

A lot of FTA counters for High funds start players with very little starting income. You should avoid these FTA counter to help prevent games playing like slow mode maps, and to help encourage the games to have less "dead turns" without action.

## At least 4 properties that can realistically belong to either player

With live maps, things can potentially stall. A LOT. By making sure a lot of properties are contested, you can help encourage a lot of fighting. More fighting is always better than less fighting.

## No significant defensive chokes (chokes at ~40% distance to the other player) that preserve income outside of very strong 2v1 setups

In live games, it is very easy for players to get scared and "wall off", causing stalling.
