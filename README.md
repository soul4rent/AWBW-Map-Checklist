# AWBW-Map-Checklist

## Standard C Rank Map Checklist
- Is the map mirrored in some form?
- Are there no contested bases?
- Are there no contested airports?
- Are all bases at least 1.5 tank turns away from interaction?
- Are all bases less than 5 tank turns away from interaction?
- Are there no instant win features?
- Are FTA counters implemented properly?
  - Does one exist for the number of bases?
- Are fronts at least 1 tank turn wide, or are they at least interesting?
- Is the map reasonably playble?
  - Is there some sort of interaction or threat before turn 10?
  - Are there no obvious cheese strategies, or strategies that have significant first or second turn advantage?
    - EX: Very easily accesible missile silos
    - EX: HQs that one player can rush before the other can defend
    - EX: A base where saving up enough money to build a piperunner wins the game with no counterplay
    - EX: Bases and Airports that can be locked by Rockets, Artillary, or Missiles without significant effort
- Are some of the income sources contested?
- Are some of the income sources reasonably safe?
- Is the income to base ratio not absurd? (EX: Income is not 40,000 Income per base)
- Is the number of unique features not absurd? (EX: 50 Com towers)
- Are most cities spaced out more than 1 tile away from eachother?
- Are most areas of the map reasonably used, and the unused areas "blocked off" by terrain? (EX: Sea tiles, mountains, pipes, large amounts of forest, etc)
- Is there a reasonable number of pre-owned properties?
- Is there some amount of terrain variety? (EX: The map isn't just all plains or all roads)

## Standard B Rank Map Checklist
- Are there reasons to go specific places throughout the map? (Com towers, Airports, Contested Income Sources, Larger income sources, Lab Units)
    - If a player wins a single area, is the game still reasonably winnable in some fashion? (EX: No "Win mid, win game")
- Are there several interesting decisions when moving throughout the map?
- Can players front switch to some degree?
- Do fronts (in general) have non-stally features such as:
  - Minimal defensive terrain around contested income sources
  - Diagonal fronts
  - X > 2 tile choke points
- Is there a reasonable number of unique features?
  - Airports (usually 1-2)
  - Com towers (Usually 1-2 per player)
- Are HQs/Labs positioned in a place where they aren't easily contested, where the optimal strategy is to focus the HQ?
    - Is it possible for a player to push the Lab(s) or HQ(s) when they have a very large advantage to close out the game?
- Are bases responsible for a reasonable number of fronts? (1-3 per base)
- Is the income to base ratio reasonable? (2 Bases: 6k-11k, 3 Bases: 5k - 9k)
- If the map has pipe seams, does breaking them provide a reasonable amount of value (Not too much "instant win")?
- Is there an even number of contested properties across all fronts?
- If the map is an island hopping map, are there at features that encourage dynamic play? (some pre-deployed landers so it isn't only infantry and air, larger islands that are multiple tank turns in size from the landing points, etc)
- Is the Map not an absurd size? (EX: 50 x 50)
- Is income spread reasonably equally between bases?
- Is the map somewhat readable and not extremely busy?
- Are heavily contested bases placed in the middle of both player's tank turns?

## Standard A Rank Map Checklist
Note: This is where map ranking becomes a lot more subjective and difficult to rank. B rank maps are often picked for tournaments, and if people like them, they are promoted to B rank and vice versa.

- Does the map have a ABBA or BAAB opening order for the optimal vehicle, without specific FTA cheese strats?
    - If the map has a battlecopter opening, does it force FTA by requiring an AA to be built for first vehicle?
- Is defensive terrain placed in locations that make the map more interesting to play?
- Does the map allow multiple expressions of playstyles? (EX: A defensive playstyle vs an "all out attack" playstyle)
- Are there many choices made throughout the map, most of which are non-obvious?
