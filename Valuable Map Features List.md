# Standard/Fog Valuable Map Features List + Rough Value Estimater

Values can be added together for an extremely rough estimate of how valueable something is on the map.
For instance, a city (+) that's chained with other valuable properties (+) in a constested area (+) is likely more valuable than an isolated city (+) that requires a transport to access (-).

Note that there are almost always numerous exceptions to everything.

| Value Rating | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| X | Game warping. Do not add to maps in most circumstances.
| ++++ | Absurdly Valuable (Properties with this rating before modifiers should not be put in heavily contested areas under most circumstances. Possible instant win situations)
| ++ | Very Valuable |
| + | Valuable |
| 0 | Negligable Value |
| - | Negative Value |

| Feature Types | Value |
| ---------------| --- |
| Loaded Missile Silos  | X |
| Bases          | +++++ |
| Opponent HQs   | +++++ |
| Opponent Owned Lab (Only one on map) | +++++ |
| Opponent Owned Labs (Multiple on map, no HQs) | +++ (Varies) | 
| Opponent Owned Cities (Be careful about TA) | ++ |
| Airports | ++ |
| Com Towers     | +  |
| Ports | + |
| Cities | + |
| Neutral Labs (No HQs) | + (Varies) |
| Labs (With HQs) | 0 |
| High defense terrain | 0 |
| Low defense terrain | - |

| Feature Type Modifiers | Value |
| -------------- | --- |
| Pivot Point / Front Switching or High Coverage Area (EX: Mid) | + |
| Contested Area / Towards Contested Area | + |
| (Properties only) Chained with other worthwhile properties | + |
| (Airports) After players have enough income to reasonably start building copters | + |
| (Com towers) After enagements with opponent's units are reasonably expected to start taking place | + |
| Isolated (no chains with other worthwile properties, valuable features 2-3 infantry turns away) | 0 |
| Property Requires Significant effort to contest (EX: Behind an Opponent's Easily defended choke point) | - |
| Feature Void Area (Minimal valuable features 2-3 turns away from the area) | - |
| Requires Significant Aggressive Action to Unlock (EX: Pipe Seam, Destroying a Black boat) | - |
| Requires Transport to Access | - | 
| Away from a constested area | - |
| Protected by an enemy unit (EX: Brush with death) | - |

**How to use:**

Take a Tile from a feature type, and add the feature type modifiers to it's value.

Example:
A city (+) in a contested area (+), on a pivot (+), chained with another city (+) is possibly more valuable than an airport (++) behind a pipe seam (-), on an island away from a contested area (-) that requires building a transport to access (-), after players have enough money for copters (+): Total: (++++) vs (+).

Use common sense when determining points. High defense terrain tiles can't be "chained with other worthwhile properties" for instance!

Features can have negative points - sometimes people take properties later than others, or even flat out ignore properties map makers think are valuable because it's too much effort.

Also note that these are rough estimations - for instance, an airport on a base light map might be more important than usual.
