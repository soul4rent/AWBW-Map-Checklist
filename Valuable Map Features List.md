# Valuable Map Features List + Rough Value Estimater

Values can be added together for an extremely rough estimate of how valueable something is on the map.
For instance, a city (+) that's chained with other valuable properties (+) in a constested area (+) is likely more valuable than an isolated city (+) that requires a transport to access (-).

Note that there are almost always numerous exceptions to everything.

| + | Valuable |
| 0 | Negligable Value |
| - | Negative Value |
